COVID-19 RNA Detection with Autoencoder
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and an autoencoder model for detecting low levels of signal from samples containing COVID-19 RNA fragments. The notebook demonstrates the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation process. The autoencoder is designed to identify subtle signals indicative of COVID-19 presence in the samples.
